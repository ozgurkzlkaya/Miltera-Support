# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We release patches to fix security vulnerabilities. Which versions are eligible for receiving such patches depends on the CVSS v3.0 Rating:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.x.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of Fixlog Technical Service Portal seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to:

**security@miltera.com.tr**

You should receive a response within 48 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.

Please include the requested information listed below (as much as you can provide) to help us better understand the nature and scope of the possible issue:

- Type of issue (buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the vulnerability
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Never commit secrets or sensitive data** to the repository
2. **Always validate and sanitize user input**
3. **Use parameterized queries** to prevent SQL injection
4. **Implement proper authentication and authorization**
5. **Keep dependencies updated** regularly
6. **Follow the principle of least privilege**
7. **Use HTTPS in production**
8. **Implement rate limiting** to prevent abuse
9. **Log security events** for monitoring
10. **Regular security audits** of the codebase

### For Users

1. **Keep your credentials secure** and never share them
2. **Use strong, unique passwords**
3. **Enable two-factor authentication** when available
4. **Report suspicious activity** immediately
5. **Keep your browser and system updated**
6. **Be cautious of phishing attempts**
7. **Log out when using shared computers**
8. **Regularly review your account activity**

## Security Features

### Authentication & Authorization

- JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Password strength validation
- Session management with Redis
- Token blacklisting for secure logout

### Input Validation & Sanitization

- Comprehensive input validation using Zod schemas
- SQL injection prevention with parameterized queries
- XSS protection with content sanitization
- File upload validation and scanning

### Security Headers

- Content Security Policy (CSP)
- X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- X-Frame-Options: DENY
- X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
- Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)
- Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin

### Rate Limiting & Protection

- IP-based rate limiting (100 requests per 15 minutes)
- Request logging and monitoring
- DDoS protection measures
- Brute force attack prevention

### Data Protection

- Encryption at rest for sensitive data
- TLS 1.3 for data in transit
- Secure session storage
- Audit logging for all critical operations

## Security Monitoring

### Automated Scans

- Weekly dependency vulnerability scans
- Container security scanning with Trivy
- SAST analysis with Semgrep
- Secrets detection with TruffleHog
- License compliance checking

### Performance Monitoring

- Real-time API performance monitoring
- Database query performance tracking
- Cache hit rate monitoring
- Error rate and response time tracking

### Security Logging

- Authentication attempts (successful and failed)
- Authorization failures
- Rate limit violations
- Suspicious activity detection
- API usage patterns

## Incident Response

### Security Incident Classification

1. **Critical**: Active exploitation, data breach, service compromise
2. **High**: Vulnerable to exploitation, potential data exposure
3. **Medium**: Security weakness, no immediate exploitation
4. **Low**: Minor security issues, best practice violations

### Response Timeline

- **Critical**: Immediate response (within 1 hour)
- **High**: Response within 4 hours
- **Medium**: Response within 24 hours
- **Low**: Response within 72 hours

### Response Process

1. **Detection**: Automated monitoring or manual report
2. **Assessment**: Evaluate severity and impact
3. **Containment**: Isolate affected systems
4. **Eradication**: Remove the threat
5. **Recovery**: Restore normal operations
6. **Post-incident**: Analysis and lessons learned

## Compliance

### Standards & Frameworks

- OWASP Top 10 compliance
- GDPR data protection requirements
- ISO 27001 security controls
- SOC 2 Type II readiness

### Regular Assessments

- Quarterly security audits
- Annual penetration testing
- Continuous vulnerability assessment
- Third-party security reviews
